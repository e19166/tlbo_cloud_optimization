# 🧠 Cloud Resource Optimization Using TLBO Algorithm

Optimizing cloud resources is a critical task in managing modern applications. This project demonstrates how to use the Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm to optimize CPU resource allocation for virtual machines in a cloud environment, ensuring cost efficiency and performance.


## 🚀 Features

* Optimization Algorithm: Implements the TLBO algorithm for resource optimization.
* Real-World Use Case: Focuses on CPU allocation in cloud environments with latency constraints.
* Easy to Extend: Modular code structure for custom optimization scenarios.
* Visualization: Graphical insights into resource allocation and workloads.
* Comprehensive Testing: Unit tests for all core functionalities.

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Pipenv or a similar dependency manager

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-resource-optimization-tlbo.git
cd cloud-resource-optimization-tlbo
```

## ⚙️ Usage
Running the Optimization
Define your VM workloads in src/problem_definition.py.
Run the main script to execute the TLBO algorithm:
bash
Copy code
python src/tlbo.py
Visualizing Results
Open the Jupyter Notebook in the notebooks directory:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook notebooks/visualization.ipynb
Follow the steps to visualize workloads vs. CPU allocations.
📊 Example Results

🔍 How It Works
Input: VM workloads and constraints.
TLBO Algorithm:
Teacher Phase: The best solution (teacher) improves the mean performance.
Learner Phase: Solutions are refined through pairwise interactions.
Output: Optimal CPU allocations that minimize cost and satisfy latency requirements.
